# Code Talkers
## Summary
Navajo code talkers used their native language to communicate military plans. America had trouble with their military plans being cracked
by japanese code breakers and causing deaths of many. Johnston, too old to fight in the war, wanted to aid in the war. Johnston thought of
a way to encode the war plans in his native tounge (Navajo). He convinced James E. Jones (Lieutenant Colonel) to run a test on how successful the
message was. It was successful and because of that, the army recruted 200 young men that spoke Navajo as Communication specialists.
